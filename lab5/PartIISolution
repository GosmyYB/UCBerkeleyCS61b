Suppose a subclass inherits a method implementation from a superclass, and implements a Java interface (thatâ€™s the "interface" keyword) that contains a method with the same name and prototype.

(a) Will Java compile the result?
A: Yes.
(b) What if the method declaration in the interface has a different return
 type?
A: No, we will get compile time error.
(c) What if the method declaration in the interface has the same return type, but a signature with a different parameter type?
A: Yes, It's OK. 
(d) What if the method declaration in the interface has the same return type, and the same number of parameters and parameter types, but those
 parameters have different names?
A: Yes, it's OK.

Conclusion:
The standard of appearing compile-time error is whether the program would confuse the compiler.
