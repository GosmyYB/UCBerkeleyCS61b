(a) At compile-time, can we assign xa to ya, and vice versa? When is a cast required?
A: At complie-time, we can not assign xa to ya, but can assign ya to xa. When we want to assgin xa to ya, a cast is required. Such like this, Y[] ya = (Y[])xa;
(b) At run-time, if ya references an array of Y’s, can we assign it to xa?
 Can we then assign it back from xa to ya?
 A: At run-time, we can assgin ya to xa, and we can not assign it back form xa to ya without casting.
(c) If xa references an array of X’s (that are not Y’s), can we assign it to ya? Can we then assign it back from ya to xa? Does it make a difference
 if the array of type X[] references objects that are all of class Y? Why
 do you think this is the case?
 A: We can assign it to ya using casting, and we can assign it back from ya to xa. Yes, It make a difference. If we use the objects' method in X[], it will invoke methods in Y's, not X's.
