Suppose a subclass inherits a "public static final" constant from a superclass, and implements a Java interface that contains a "public static final" constant with the same name.

(a) Will Java compile the result? Does it make any difference whether the
 constant in the superclass and the constant in the interface have the
 same value?
 A: No. 
(b) Write a main() method in the subclass that accesses the constant using the same name used in the superclass and the Java interface. Will Java compile the result? Does it make any difference whether the constant in the superclass and the constant in the interface have the same value?
(c) Figure out how to modify your main() method so that it accesses and prints one of the two conflicting values. (Look to the Lecture 9 notes for clues.) Make sure your code compiles and runs without errors.

The subclass can use "super" keyword or the superclss' name to refers to the constant in the superclass. The subclass can only use the interface name to refer to the constatnt in interface.
